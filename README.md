# DingDong
A Raspberry Pi operated doorbell.

The project consists of a relatively simple hardware layout, and a RPi.

It uses Firebase for push notifications and to store settings of the doorbell, so that multiple outputs can be enabled/disabled (e.g. you can silence the gong in the house but still receive a push notification).
